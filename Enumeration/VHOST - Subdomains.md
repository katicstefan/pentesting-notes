# VHOST/Subdomain enumeration

```
```shell

In `ffuf`, you can exclude results based on the content by using the `-fw`, `-fl`, or `-fs` options, which allow you to filter by words, lines, or size respectively. Hereâ€™s how you can use each of them:

### 1. Exclude by Words (`-fw`):

To exclude results that contain a certain number of words:

bash

Copy code

`ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -fw <number_of_words_to_exclude>`

### 2. Exclude by Lines (`-fl`):

To exclude results that contain a certain number of lines:

bash

Copy code

`ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -fl <number_of_lines_to_exclude>`

### 3. Exclude by Size (`-fs`):

To exclude results based on the response size:

bash

Copy code

`ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -fs <size_in_bytes_to_exclude>`

### Example

If you want to exclude all responses that have exactly 200 words or 10 lines, you would run:

bash

Copy code

`ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -fw 200 -fl 10`

If you want to exclude results based on varying sizes (e.g., between 1500 and 1600 bytes), you can use a custom script or tool to preprocess your results, or you can adjust your wordlist to avoid those responses altogether.

**Note:** As of now, `ffuf` doesn't directly support a feature to exclude results by a variable number of words, lines, or size in a range. You may need to manually filter these results post-scan.
```

```
In `ffuf`, you can fuzz for specific file extensions using the `-e` option. This allows you to specify one or more file extensions to append to each word in your wordlist during the fuzzing process.

### Basic Usage

bash

Copy code

`ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -e .php,.html,.txt`

### Example Command

If you want to fuzz for `.php`, `.html`, and `.txt` files, you can run:

bash

Copy code

`ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -e .php,.html,.txt`
